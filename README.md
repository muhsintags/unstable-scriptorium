## Build & Run
#build--run

**Locally / in Codespaces:**

```
./gradlew assembleDebug      # debug build
./gradlew assembleRelease    # signed release build (requires keystore secrets)
```

## Contributing
#contributing

This is currently a solo personal project, but bug reports, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome — open an [Issue](https://github.com/muhsintags/Stable-Scriptorium/issues) any time.

Feel free to fork the repo and build your own version too. Some ideas to get you started:

- ▸ Build a **philosophy library** — Stoic, Confucian, or other classical texts instead of religious ones
- ▸ **Translate the app into your own language** before official support arrives — a native speaker's translation is often more accurate than a machine one (e.g. Japanese, before it's officially supported)
- ▸ Add a **new sacred or classical text** not currently included
- ▸ Extend the **comparative reading mode** with more viewing options or additional traditions
